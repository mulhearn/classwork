A summary of the content in the core required courses:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf PHY 104A - Introductory Methods of Mathematical Physics}
{\it Lecture - 3 hours; extensive problem solving. Prerequisite: courses 9B, 9C, 9D [or 9HB, 9HC, 9HD] and Mathematics 21D, 22A, and 22B with grade C- or better or consent of instructor. Introduction to the mathematics used in upper-division physics courses, including applications of vector spaces, Fourier analysis, partial differential equations. - I. (I.)}

Recently taught by Scalettar and Luty.  Luty teaches this as a boot camp for upper division courses:  vectors, expansion in small parameters, and PDEs.  All topics which are in principle should have been seen before, but students clearly need practice with problems.

\item {\bf PHY 105A - Analytical Mechanics}
{\it Lecture - 3 hours; extensive problem solving. Prerequisite: courses 9B, 9C, 9D [or 9HB, 9HC, 9HD] and Mathematics 21D, 22A, and 22B passed with grade C– or better; or consent of department; course 104A and 105A passed with a grade C– or better or consent of department required for 105B. Principles and applications of Newtonian mechanics; introduction to Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s equations. - I-II. (I-II.)}

Recently taught by Calderon, Cebra, Svoboda, and Conway.  Covers Morin 1-5.  This course is heavy on problem solving.  Morin focuses more on challenging problems, and less on mathematical formalism (e.g. leaves out Hamiltonian)
Not all instructors reach 5 in first quarter.

\item {\bf PHY 105B - Analytical Mechanics}
{\it Lecture - 3 hours; extensive problem solving. Prerequisite: courses 9B, 9C, 9D [or 9HB, 9HC, 9HD] and Mathematics 21D, 22A, and 22B passed with grade C– or better; or consent of department; course 104A and 105A passed with a grade C– or better or consent of department required for 105B. Principles and applications of Newtonian mechanics; introduction to Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s equations. - I-II. (I-II.)}

Prerequisite: courses 9B, 9C, 9D [or 9HB, 9HC, 9HD] and Mathematics 21D, 22A, and 22B passed with grade C– or better, or consent of department; prerequisite for 110B is courses 110A and 104A passed with a grade of C– or better or consent of department; prerequisite for course 110C is courses 110B and 104B passed with a grade of C– or better, or consent of department.

Recently taught by Da Silva Neto and Yu.  Covers Griffiths 1-4.  Yu extends to include complex analysis of La Place's equation.  Includes a recap of vector calculus, but Da Silva Neto reports a benefit from 104A  (Math Methods.)

\item {\bf PHY 110B - Electricity and Magnetism}
{\it Lecture - 3 hours; extensive problem solving. Prerequisite: courses 9B, 9C, 9D [or 9HB, 9HC, 9HD] and Mathematics 21D, 22A, and 22B passed with grade C– or better, or consent of department; prerequisite for 110B is courses 110A and 104A passed with a grade of C– or better or consent of department; prerequisite for course 110C is courses 110B and 104B passed with a grade of C– or better, or consent of department. Theory of electrostatics, electromagnetism, Maxwell’s equations, electromagnetic waves. - II-III-I. (II-III-I.)}

Recently taught by Yu.  Griffiths 5-9.  Rapid pace for subject matter, so problem solving is left mainly for homework.  No breathing room for computational physics.

\item {\bf PHY 110C - Electricity and Magnetism}
{\it Lecture - 3 hours; extensive problem solving. Prerequisite: courses 9B, 9C, 9D [or 9HB, 9HC, 9HD] and Mathematics 21D, 22A, and 22B passed with grade C– or better, or consent of department; prerequisite for 110B is courses 110A and 104A passed with a grade of C– or better or consent of department; prerequisite for course 110C is courses 110B and 104B passed with a grade of C– or better, or consent of department.

\section{Objectives}

\section{Open Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the role of advanced classes not part of any major or specialization:  104C,123,...  Is 105C ever offered?  It seems required for physical oceanography.
\item What actually is the maximum number of required credits allowed in a major?
Looks empirically like 90 for some reason...
\end{itemize}

\section{Answered Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can we require a class if e.g. less than A in certain prerequisites? No.  C- is threshold for pre-req.
\item Do specializations have to stay within any credit limits?  Could we have "Physics BS with specialization in Computational Physics" that exceeds credit limits?  No.
\item Astrophysics specializations comes at high extra course load:  180,150-156, and lab course 157.  Is this "fair" to the non-astro faculty?  Can this foot print be reduced?  For elective courses, students vote with their feet, and Astronomy electives are popular.  Labs have been discontinued and many of these courses are offered only every other year. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Problems and Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item Relevant stuff for QM (Angular Momentum, Central Forces) is in 105B, but only 105A is a preq.  In general, 105B is major absence from applied physics requirements.  Not all 105A+B instructors even cover Hamiltonian formalism.
\item 104A is taught by Luty as a sort of boot camp for problem solving in upper division courses... but only a pre-req for 115A.
\item Damped driven oscillator is missing from mechanics.
\item We don't always cover Hamiltonian formalism before reaching QM.
\item Drop 110C.  Need to cover vector potential in B.  Need to cover special relativity elsewhere.
\item Curro thinks we need to add QIT somewhere, at least as elective, or risk being left behind.
\end{itemize}

\section{Big Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have three tracks, essentially:  9H, 9, and transfers.  Current policy amounts to asking 9H students to wait for everyone else.  Maybe we can make 9H students overlap other tracks in Sophomore (vs Junior) year.
\item More computing!!!
\end{itemize}
