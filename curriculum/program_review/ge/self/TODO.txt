Hello Chris,

You are the instructor for a course that satisfy General Education
requirements (Literacies).  As part of our undergraduate program
review, we are required by the Academic Senate to conduct a
self-review of our GE courses.

The courses you are or  have been instructor for are:

Please, **AS SOON AS POSSIBLE** visit the following site:

https://ge.ucdavis.edu/faculty-staff-resources

And click the link for the literacies that your course provides, specifically:

Visual
Scientific

Then answer the following question to me, with Yes or No:

Does your course contain the minimum elements (MEs) for its literacy/literacies?

(If your answer is "Yes" we are done.  If your answer is "No", we will
develop a plan together to modify the course as needed to meet the
requirements, or drop the literacies from the course entirely.)

cheers,
Mike
