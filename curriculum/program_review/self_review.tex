\section{Overview of the major}

Questions: What are the Program Learning Outcomes identified for this major? What is the role of this major in undergraduate education on the campus, i.e., how does the major contribute to the undergraduate educational mission of the campus? Is the major clearly distinguished from other similar majors on campus?

Refer to the catalog description of the major and the other majors reviewed in the same cluster (Appendix A). Describe any inaccuracies in the catalog description and explain plans for correcting them. Identify the other majors in the cluster that are most similar to yours and explain how your major differs from them.

\section{Outcome of Previous Program Review}

The committee report of the Undergraduate Instruction Program Review
(UIPR) and the Review Team Report from the previous review are
included in the appendix.  Spurred by these reports and other
concerns, the department has been revising its undergraduate curriculum
over the past five years, and the proposed revisions are included in
the appendix. While the reports identified strengths in
the program, we will address here the weaknesses that were listed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Space, Lab Conditions and Maintenance:  the review team was concerned that the undergraduate lab space was ``shabby and in need of renovation''.  We are happy to report a number of past and current investments and rennovations:  (Please get from Tracy)
122 updates, new computational physics lab, etc)

\item Transfer Student Readiness: Following the recommendations of the
  committee, we began selective major review in (Please get date from
  Amy).  The department has seen a substantial drop in transfer
  enrollment at a level that we find potentially troubling if it
  persists.  It is difficult to decouple from the impact of COVID-19
  and an overall drop in transfer enrollment campus wide (CONFIRM?).
  It is also too soon to draw conclusions on the impact of this
  changes on the average time to degree and the fraction of students
  leaving without a degree.  We are in the process of gathering these
  statistics specifically for transfer students.  This concern was
  also a major focus of the undergraduate curriculum update as
  described in more details below.

\item Advising:  work with Amy on this one.

\item PHY 122: the review was concerned that students were generally
  poorly prepared for this upper division lab course.  Following the
  recommendations of the committee, we introduced a new course, PHY
  80, as a prerequisite for PHY 122.  As described in more detail
  below, this was also a major focus of the undergraduate curriculum
  update, which makes PHY 80 a required course for all majors (not
  just those taking PHY 122).

\item Communication Skills: The review team reported anecdotal
  evidence of student disastisfaction with the level of development of
  skills in writing and oral presentaion.  Addressing this deficiency
  immediately runs into several major practical challenges.  With a
  throughput of order 60 students per year, even having each student
  provide a 15 minute presentation would be a commitment of 15 hours:
  50\% of standard lecture course.  As we are limited in the number of
  units which we can require of our majors, we have already made
  difficult cuts to required coursework.  We don't see a way to
  definitely address this problem that doesn't include either (1) an
  increase in the number of units we are allowed to require for our
  students, or (2) improving the quality of GE instruction so that
  students receive adequate training in writing and oral
  commmunication as part of the 50\% of the coursework they complete
  outside of their major requirements.  However, one anticipated
  outcome of the updated curriculum is that four-year students will
  have more time for elective offerings in physics.  We think
  therefore, that an incremental way forward here is to provide an
  elective course designed to provide more opportunities for
  practicing scientific communication.

\item Computational Instruction: The review team noted that ECS 30 was
  not adequately preparing our students for computational physics.  We
  have since introduced five new computational physics courses: PHY
  40,45,110L,112L, and 115L.  This was a major focus of the curriculum
  update that is described in more detail below.

\item PHY 157: The review team noted that demand for PHY 157 is
  greater than it's capacity.  This troughput is limited by several
  practical concerns: the time of year during which weather is
  favorable for observation, safety concerns which limit the numbrer
  of people that can be on the room for observation, and limited
  faculty capable of teaching the course.  With the retirement of
  Prof. Tony Tyson, Prof. Tucker Jones has been teaching the course,
  but we have struggled to maintain throughput, let alone increase it.
  We recently aquired a grant for a new telescope, and perhaps this
  can improve the situation?  Talk with Pat...

\end{itemize}

Describe the undergraduate curriculum update.
