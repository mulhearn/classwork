Issues still persisting after last year:

1) Lab circuit diagrams and descriptions have been debugged through two
rounds of students.  But pre-lab calculations could be expanded in
most cases, and more guidance on the write-ups would be helpful.

2) For the diode lab, Brian is building some transformer assemblies
that will be safe for the students to use (they will only have access
to stepped-down secondary.)  This should drop in while making the
rectification portion of the lab a bit more realistic than as written,
(using a function generator).

3) Last year, every group brought in an external broadcast in the AM
radio lab, so I guess the circuit is good enough.  But: (a) The audio
amplifier portion has the embarrassing tendency to motor-boat, due to
multiple AC coupled stages, a sure-sign of an amateur amplifier design
(b) I bet this would be alot easier on the students if the outside
antenna had a battery powered pre-amplifier, (c) in alternate.tex
there is a folded cascode design that worked beautifully, but I
decided was too complicated for the students.

4) The questions to the take-home midterm were all posted to CHEGG.
Won't do that again.  Also, physics students and H&H problems don't
mix.  The language isn't usually precise, there aren't unique
solutions, etc.  I'd write more of my own problems.
