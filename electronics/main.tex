\begin{verbatim}
Chapter 1: Equivalent Circuits
Big Idea: Maxwell's equations provide a complete description of any electrical
device, but they are impractical to apply to real world problems. We develop
approximate laws that are better suited for understanding electrical devices.

Fundamental Physics: Drude Law, Electric fields and drift velocity, Charge and Fields of DC circuits
Core Topics: Ohm's Law, KVL+KCL, Voltage Divider, Resistors in Parallel and Series, Source and Load Resistance, VI diagrams, Thevenin Equivalent Circuits
Practical Topics: Schematics, Bread Boards, Power Supplies, DMM, Simulation, Safety

Chapter 2: Phase
Big Idea: We use the phase of complex numbers in place of differential equations
to understand time-dependent circuits. This enables us to build circuits which filter or resonate based on frequency.

Fundamental Physics: Capacitance and Inductance, Fourier transform
Core Topics:  Time-Dependent Circuits, Transient Response of RLC devices, AC, Impedance, Filters, Resonance, Transformers
Practical Topics: Function Generator, Oscilloscope, Decibels, Decoupling, Bode Plots 

Chapter 3: Semiconductors
Big Idea: Semiconductors provide a new form of charge carrier (positive holes) essential for modern electronics.

Fundamental Physics: Band Theory (no conduction in full bands), PN-junction behavior
Core Topics: Diode, LEDs, Transistor (BJT and FET), Amplification, Input and Output Impedance, Transconductance, Integrated Circuits
Practical Topics: Transformer, Unregulated and Regulated DC power, Negative voltage sources, Emitter Follower, Common-Emitter Amplifier, Switch, Diode and Transistor Curves, Datasheets

Chapter 4: Feedback
Big Idea: Coupling the output of a device back to its input can make an imperfect device appear to be nearly ideal. A wonderful abstraction using this idea is the operational amplifier, which can be used for countless applications.

Fundamental Physics: Feedback phase - exponential damping vs. resonance
Core Topics: Op-Amps, Op-Amp Rules, Positive and Negative Feedback, Gain-Bandwidth Product, Limitations of Real Devices
Practical Topics: Follower, Amplifier, Adder, Active Filter
