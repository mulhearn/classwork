This lab will introduce calculations and plotting techniques using numpy arrays within Scientific Python.

\section{Plotting discrete data and continuous functions}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Consider the Jupyter notebook example in Fig.~\ref{fig:plotsin} which plots a sine function sampled at discrete values.  Note the following key features, which you will use repeatedly today and in future labs:
\begin{itemize}
\item Use of global variables {\tt UPPER} and {\tt STEP} at the top of the snippet, allowing for easy adjustment of parameters that affect the plot.
\item Use of {\tt np.arange} to define an array of x values.
\item Creation of the array y, defined by $y = \sin(2\pi x / 5)$ for each value of x.  One of the great joys of using numpy is the ability to avoid getting bogged down with explicit for loops.
\item Use of slicing techniques {\tt x[:5]} to show only the first five entries for debugging.  
\item Plotting the arrays of $x$ and $y$ values with {\tt plt.plot}  using the {\tt "bo"} option for blue circles.
\item Defining appropriate axis labels with {\tt plt.xlabel} and {\tt plt.xlabel}. 
\item Creation of a legend using the {\tt label} option to {\tt plt.plot} and the {plot.legend()} command.
\end{itemize}
Notice that even in this simple example, I've added some intermediate feedback from my code in the form of the screen dumps of the first few values of $x$ and $y$.  It's a common pitfall to try and rush ahead to the final product when programming.  But it is much faster and reliable to break your task into small steps, and establish feedback at each small step. 
	To plot a continuous function with Scientific Python, you will still use discrete data but:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Use much finer binning of the $x$-axis variable to draw a smooth curve. 
 \item Use the line option {\tt "-"} or dashed line {\tt "--"} instead of points with {\tt "o"}. 
\end{itemize} 

\noindent
{\bf Plot 1:}  Plot the quadratic function $y = x^2$ with the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Plot in the range $x = [0,20)$.
 \item Plot discrete samples with a step size of $2$ using blue circles.
 \item On the same axis, plot the corresponding smooth function using a red solid line.
 \item Add appropriate axis labels. 
 \item Add a legend for the ``discrete'' and the ``smooth''  function.
\end{itemize}

\section{Multivariate analysis using boolean masks}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{Using boolean masks to cut on variable $y$.}
\label{fig:booleanmasks}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A powerful technique in Scientific Python for performing analysis involving multiple variables uses boolean masks as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:booleanmasks}.  In the example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two numpy arrays $x$ and $y$ {\tt of the same length} are defined to contain the collected data.
\item The cut defined by $y > 1$ is a boolean array of the same length as $x$ and $y$ which is true at indices where the condition is met and false where it is not.
\item The subset of the entire $y$ array defined by {\tt y[cut]} consists only of those entries of $y$ for which the condition $y>1$ is met.
\item The subset of the entire $x$ array defined by {\tt x[cut]} consists only of those entries of $x$ for which the condition $y>1$ is met for the corresponding y value.
\end{itemize}
The last item shows the real power of this technique, one can look at one variable subject to constraints on another variable.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
$t~(\rm s)$ & $v~(\rm V)$ & $n$ \\
0.4  & 0.25  &  2.8 \\
1.1  & 2.37  &  7.3 \\
1.4  & 1.69  &  9.7 \\
1.9  & 0.93  &  1.3 \\
2.5  & -1.0  &  6.2 \\
3.0  & 0.95  &  4.8 \\
3.4  & 1.22  &  6.9 \\
4.1  & 0.54  &  4.0 \\
4.4  & 0.37  &  1.9 \\
4.8  & 0.13  &  4.0 \\
5.5  & -2.04  &  9.5 \\
6.2  & -2.06  &  8.7 \\
6.5  & -0.81  &  2.3 \\
7.0  & -0.95  &  5.3 \\
7.5  & 0.98  &  9.7 \\
7.9  & 0.27  &  8.3 \\
8.5  & -0.81  &  0.1 \\
9.0  & -0.59  &  5.1 \\
9.4  & -0.37  &  4.4 \\
9.9  & 0.56  &  9.9 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Next consider the sample data in Table~\ref{tbl:hfnoiseeg} which comes from experimental measurements of a voltage level $v$ at discrete times $t$.  The measurement is subject to a high-frequency noise monitoring by the variable $n$.  The noise is only present for $n > 6.0$.  A straightforward way to load this data into scientific python is by defining numpy arrays for each variable as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
t = np.array([0.4, 1.1, 1.4, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.4, 4.1, 4.4, 4.8, 
                     5.5, 6.2, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 7.9, 8.5, 9.0, 9.4, 9.9])
v = np.array([ 0.25, 2.37, 1.69, 0.93, -1.0, 0.95, 1.22,   
                      0.54, 0.37, 0.13, -2.04, -2.06, -0.81, -0.95,  
                      0.98, 0.27, -0.81, -0.59, -0.37, 0.56])
n = np.array([2.8, 7.3, 9.7, 1.3, 6.2, 4.8, 6.9, 4.0, 1.9, 4.0,  
                      9.5, 8.7, 2.3, 5.3, 9.7, 8.3, 0.1, 5.1, 4.4, 9.9])
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
{\bf Plot 2} Prepare a plot of the sample data subject to the following:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Plot the voltage as a function of time as discrete data using red points.
 \item Define the boolean array {\tt keep} based on the noise reducing condition $n<=6.0$.
 \item Plot the voltage as a function of time, subject to the noise reducing condition using blue points.
 \item Plot the function $\sin(2 \pi x / 10)$ as a smooth function.
 \item Add appropriate axis labels.
 \item Add a legend for ``raw'' data with no cut, ``clean'' data with noise removed, and your continuous ``sin'' function.   
\end{itemize}
Your plot will reveal a clear sine function in the discrete data (after noise removal) consistent with the continuous function.  {\bf This is a sign-off point for the lab.}   (Each student should be prepared to explain any line in your code.)

\section{The Logistics Map}
The logistics map is the recurrence relation
\begin{displaymath}
x_{n+1} = r \, x_n \, (1 - x_n)
\end{displaymath}
with the variable $x$ between $0$ and $1$.  The variable $x$ can be thought to represent the ratio of a population to its maximum possible value.  The population increases due to birth and decreases due to starvation as the population approaches it's maximum value ($x$ near 1).  This leads to the non-linear relationship that defines the logistic map.   The mapping keeps the variable x between $0$ and $1$ as long as the parameter r is in the range $[0,4]$.

The logistics map is frequently encountered as a simple example of a chaotic system emerging from a simple non-linear system.  If we consider the long term behavior of the population $x$ as a function of the parameter $r$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:logmap}, we see that for values of $r$ less than $3$ the population approaches a single fixed value.  At the value $r=3$ the non-linear system exhibits bifurcation with the population oscillating between two values.  As $r$ increase, further bifurcations occur at an ever increasing rate until the systems exhibits chaotic behavior alternating with occasional returns to stable oscillations.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figs/labs//plotting/bifurcation.png} 
\caption{Long term behavior of the logistics map.}
\label{fig:logmap}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figs/labs//plotting/logmapstart.png} 
\caption{Modeling the logistics map.}
\label{fig:logmapstart}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The long term behavior of the logistics map can be easily modeled in Scientific Python.  A start is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:logmapstart} where you should understand:
\begin{itemize}
\item An array of $r$ values is defined.
\item An array of $x$ values of the same size as $r$ is defined and initialized to an arbitrary non-zero value (0.01).
\item Two example iterations of the logistic map are applied.
\item The next two iterations of the values of $x$ are plotted as function of $r$ on the same plot.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
{\bf Plot 3:}  Reproduce the figure in Fig.~\ref{fig:logmap} by doing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Define two global variables {\tt ITER = 10} and {\tt PLOT = 5}.
\item Apply the logistics map {\tt ITER} times by using a for loop.
\item Apply the logistics map an additional {\tt PLOT} times, plotting the values of $x$ as a function of $r$, as in the example, each time.
\end{itemize}
You'll observe the long term behavior by increasing the value of {\tt ITER} to a large value, such as 10,000.
You'll see the full dependence on $r$ by decreasing the step size in the initialization of the numpy array $r$ to something like $0.001$.  You'll observe the chaotic behavior by increasing the value of {\tt PLOT} to 100 or even 1000 iterations.  To make a prettier plot using finer points (once you have a large number of points) you can reduce the size by adjusting the {\tt s=10} parameter in the call to {\tt plt.scatter} to something like {\tt s=0.0001}.
